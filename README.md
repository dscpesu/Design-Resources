# Design-Resources
A repository to organize and maintain all design resources and other creatives used or generated at DSC PESU.


# Guidelines
Mentioned below are a few guidelines that I think would help in creating and maintaining quality and consistency in any creatives that are pushed out of the club.

## Palette
The DSC chapters are community groups for students from any academic background in their undergraduate or graduate term, and come under the Google Developers brand, so I strongly suggest the use of Google's brand palette to theme the creatives. There are currently three palettes to be aware of:

### Google's Old Brand Palette (till 2013)
Google's old palette included four of their signature identity colors:

| Color | Hex Code |
|--|--|
| Blue | 4285F4 |
| Red | DB4437 |
| Yellow | F4B400 |
| Green | 0F9D58 |

### Google's New Brand Palette (2013 onwards)
Google's new palette included four of their signature identity colors, but three of them now in a new shade:

| Color | Hex Code |
|--|--|
| Blue | 4285F4 |
| Red | EA4335 |
| Yellow | FBBC05 |
| Green | 34A853 |

### The Google Developers Brand Palette
I took the GD Palette from the GD and DSC Logo.
Now, for some unknown reason, the GD brand palette inherits Google's New Brand Palette, but takes the Green from the Old Brand Palette:

| Color | Hex Code |
|--|--|
| Blue | 4285F4 |
| Red | EA4335 |
| Yellow | FBBC05 |
| Green | 0F9D58 |
| Gray | 676C72 |

**I recommend you to stick to Google's New Brand Palette only.**

## Typography
Many fonts look good for Web and Mobile, but I recommend using Roboto or Open Sans.

Google also has their own proprietary fonts: Product Sans and Google Sans.

I primarily use these fonts in my designs to get things done. They look really good with designs created using Google's palette, so you can use them for some in-house creatives too. Product Sans for headings, Google Sans for the body.

## More on the Palette
I did some snooping around and extracted all the different colors Google uses in their products. Here is a neat dump of them:

# The Repo
The Repository contains all the lossless creative content I could find anywhere online that had anything to do with Google, and a dump of all the content I created within the club, including those assets I created for the website. Enjoy!

**That's all, folks!**
